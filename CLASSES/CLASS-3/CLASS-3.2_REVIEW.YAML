1) SPARK STRUTURED STREAMING:
    1.1) OVERVIEW: 
        - spark structured streaming is a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the spark sql engine
        - it allows to process data in real time
    1.2) THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROCESSING DATA IN BATCH AND STREAMING:
        - batch processing: process data in fixed-size files or time intervals. it has a beginning and an end:
            FOR EXAMPLE:
              OLAP -> STAGING -> DW -> REPORTS

        - streaming processing: process data in real time. It is used when the data is generated in real time. it never ends:
            FOR EXAMPLE:
              E_COMMERCE -> PROCESSING -> REPORTS AND ALERTS
